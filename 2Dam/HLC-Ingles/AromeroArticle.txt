Music is the Best!

I love music, Urban Trap is my favourite musical genre. Always I can I connect my headphones in my phone and put the type of
music I want to listen in the moment. However, how I choose what I listen to at different times?

I usually choose more active music to do some of sport or going run. If I am at home I feel like I am a dj, I mix some songs depending of what I want, 
and I love to sing them. Certainly, I don't care what I am listening if I like it, maybe can be Rock'n Roll and then Reggaeton.

I like so much the music because deppending your mood, it can calm you down, make you sing or dance, or just have a chill time.
Also, I think the best time to listen to music is when I am in a travel. When I am doing a long travel, music make 
it shorter.

What about you? Do you like listen to music? What is your favourite genre?
